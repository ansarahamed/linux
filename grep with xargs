grep -irn "search content" .

Flags

-i  //Ignore case
-r  //If . Recursively so it looks for present directory and so on and so forth
    //If *.* given , need to specify the type of file to look into, could be *.* *.filetype tc., in the current directory
-n //Displays the line # along with line, where the search string present
-l //displays only the file name not the searched content line


-v // Inverts the search and displays all the lines where the "search context" is   not there . Usually comes handy while chaining of commands
-o // only matching, means instead of displaying the entire line it displays only the search content in the line

Xargs:

The xargs command  is used to build and execute command lines from standard input. It takes input from a pipeline or a file, and for each line of input, it executes a specified command.

It takes input from the chained command replacing -I {}


cat sc-1.html | grep -o " [a-z\-]*\.js\:[0-9]*" | xargs -I {} grep {} target_file.txt

//Xargs  command would get a input from previous command for each line of output to grep in target_file

//The -I {} option tells xargs to replace every occurrence of {} in the command that follows with the input it receives from the previous command in the pipeline.
//{} is place holder

// So if the previous commands output has 3 lines, it would also insist the following xargs to execute grep or any other command 3 times
1.txt
2.txt
3.txt
then this would execute 3 commands as below
grep <1.txt> target_file.txt
grep <2.txt> target_file.txt
grep <3.txt> target_file.txt
